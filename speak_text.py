# This is an example program to show how to generate speech with the Raspberry Pi.  
# You can see the full written tutorial here:  http://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/make-your-raspberry-pi-speak/
# This program makes the Pi speak aloud the text entered by the user and it also records it to a file named Text.wav.

from num2words import num2words
from subprocess import call


cmd_beg= 'espeak '
cmd_end= ' | aplay /home/pi/Desktop/Text.wav  2>/dev/null' # To play back the stored .wav file and to dump the std errors to /dev/null
cmd_out= '--stdout > /home/pi/Desktop/Text.wav ' # To store the voice file

text = input("Enter the Text: ")
print(text)

#Replacing ' ' with '_' to identify words in the text entered
text = text.replace(' ', '_')

#Calls the Espeak TTS Engine to read aloud a Text
call([cmd_beg+cmd_out+text+cmd_end], shell=True)
