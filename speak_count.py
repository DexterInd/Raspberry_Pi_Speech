#Program to Count Numbers 
# This is an example program to show how to generate speech with the Raspberry Pi.  
# You can see the full written tutorial here:  http://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/make-your-raspberry-pi-speak/
#This program makes the Pi count numbers down from the number entered by the user till zero.

from num2words import num2words
from subprocess import call

cmd_beg= 'espeak '
cmd_end= ' 2>/dev/null' # To dump the std errors to /dev/null


x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
count = num2words(x)+' Count Down Starts'
print(count)

#Replacing ' ' with '_' to identify words in the text entered
count = count.replace(' ', '_')
#Calls the Espeak TTS Engine to read aloud a Text
call([cmd_beg+count+cmd_end], shell=True)

#To do a Count Down
for i in range(x,-1,-1): # To count numbers down from the entered number till zero
	cmd=num2words(i) #To convert the Numbers to Text
	print(i)
    #Calls the Espeak TTS Engine to read aloud the Numbers
	call([cmd_beg+cmd+cmd_end], shell=True)
